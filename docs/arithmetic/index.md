# Introduction to Arithmetic

Arithmetic is a branch of mathematics that deals with numbers and basic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Importance

Arithmetic is one of the oldest branches of mathematics, originating from the ancient Greek word '**Arithmos**,'
meaning numbers. It involves the study and application of basic operations on numbers, which are essential for everyday calculations and more advanced mathematical concepts. Arithmetic forms the foundation for various mathematical disciplines, including algebra, calculus, and statistics, and is crucial in daily life, such as managing finances, cooking, and shopping.

In grade 9, students will explore various arithmetic concepts, including:

- Properties of numbers

- Operations with integers, fractions, and decimals

- Ratios and proportions

- Percentages

- Word problems involving real-life scenarios

- Taxation, Profit and Loss, and Commission calculations

We will study these topics through explanations, examples, exercises, and quizzes in this unit.
