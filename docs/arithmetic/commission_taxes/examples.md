# Commission and Taxation Examples

## Commission Examples

#### Example 1

An agent earns 1% commission on Rs. 18,000. Calculate Commission amount, and Net Income.

- SP = Rs. 18,000

- Rate = 1%

- $Commission = ( \dfrac{1}{100}\times 18000 = Rs. 180 )$

- Net Income = Rs. 18,000 − Rs. 180 = Rs. 17,820

#### Example 2

A staff earns Rs. 12,000 monthly salary and 1% commission on sales above Rs. 6,00,000.

Monthly sales = Rs. 10,00,000. Calculate the total salary

- Commission-able amount = Rs. 4,00,000

- $Commission = ( \dfrac{1 \times 400000}{100} = Rs. 4,000 )$

- Total Salary = Rs. 12,000 + Rs. 4,000 = Rs. 16,000

<div className="question">
  <b>Q1.</b> Staff earns Rs. 21,000 total income. Salary = Rs. 11,000

Sales = Rs. 5,00,000. Commission Rate = ?.

<summary>Reveal solution</summary>

- Commission = Rs. 21,000 − Rs. 11,000 = Rs. 10,000

- $Rate = ( \dfrac{10,000}{5,00,000} \times 100\% = 2\% )$

So, the commission rate is 2%.

### Example 3: Tiered Commission

Total sales = Rs. 25,00,000
Commission rates:

- 0.5% on first Rs. 10,00,000
- 1% on next Rs. 5,00,000
- 2% on remaining Rs. 10,00,000

  Total Commission = ?, Net Income = ?, Overall commission % = ?

$Formula: Commission = (Rate/100) × Amount$

1. 0.5% on first Rs. 10,00,000

- Commission1 = (0.5/100) × 10,00,000 = 0.005 × 10,00,000 = Rs. 5,000

2. 1% on next Rs. 5,00,000

   - Commission2 = (1/100) × 5,00,000 = 0.01 × 5,00,000 = Rs. 5,000

3. 2% on remaining Rs. 10,00,000

   - Remaining = Total − (10,00,000 + 5,00,000) = 10,00,000

   - Commission3 = (2/100) × 10,00,000 = 0.02 × 10,00,000 = Rs. 20,000

$Total Commission = Commission1 + Commission2 + Commission3$

= 5,000 + 5,000 + 20,000

= Rs. 30,000

$Net Income (seller) = Total Sales − Total Commission$

= 25,00,000 − 30,000

= Rs. 24,70,000

$ \text{Overall commission percent} = (Total Commission / Total Sales) × 100$

= (30,000 / 25,00,000) × 100

= 1.2%

## Taxation Examples

### Example 1

Marked Price = Rs. 12,000

Discount = 15% → Rs. 1,800

Price after discount = Rs. 10,200

$\text{VAT} = 13\% of Rs. 10,200$

→ $( \dfrac{13}{100} \times 10200 = Rs. 1,326 )$

### Example 2

600 students, monthly fee = Rs. 1,200

Tax paid by school = ?

$Annual fee = Rs. 1,200 × 12 × 600 = Rs. 86,40,000$

$Tax = 1\% of Rs. 86,40,000 → Rs. 86,400$
