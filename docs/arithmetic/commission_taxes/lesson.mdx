# Commission and Taxes

## Commission

### Definition

Commission is a fixed percentage of the **selling price** paid to an agent for helping in a transaction.

It is common in real estate, banking, insurance, and retail.

### Key Terms

| Term                | Meaning                                               |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Selling Price (SP)  | Total price at which goods/services are sold          |
| Commission Rate (%) | Percentage of SP given to the agent as commission     |
| Commission Amount   | Actual money earned by the agent / given to the agent |
| Net Income          | Amount received by seller after commission            |

### Formulas

- $ \text{Commission Amount} = \dfrac{\text{Rate Percentage} \times \text{SP}}{100}$

- $ \text{Net Income} = \text{SP} - \text{Commission Amount}$

- $ \text{Commission Percent} = \dfrac{\text{Commission Amount}}{\text{SP}} \times 100\%$

### Tiered Commission

Tiered (or stepped) commission applies different rates to portions of the selling price that fall within defined brackets.

Net Income = SP - Commission Amounts

## Taxation

Tax is a mandatory financial charge imposed by the government.

It funds public services like education, health, and infrastructure.
