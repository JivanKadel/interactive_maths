# Exercises to Sets

<div className="question">
  <b>Q1.</b> Let `A = {1,2,3,4}` and `B = {3,4,5,6}`. Find:

- A ∪ B
- A ∩ B
- A − B
- B − A

<details>
<summary>Reveal solution</summary>

**Given:**  
$A = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$  
$B = \{3, 4, 5, 6\}$

**Solutions:**

- **A ∪ B** (Union):  
  Combine all elements from both sets, without repetition.  
  $A ∪ B = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$

- **A ∩ B** (Intersection):  
  Elements common to both sets.  
  $A ∩ B = \{3, 4\}$

- **A − B** (Difference):  
  Elements in A that are not in B.  
  $A − B = \{1, 2\}$

- **B − A** (Difference):  
  Elements in B that are not in A.  
  $B − A = \{5, 6\}$

<div className="question">
  <b>Q2.</b> Find the cardinality of:
   - `A = {letters in “KATHMANDU”}`
   - `B = {multiples of 5 ≤ 50}`

<details>
<summary>Reveal solution</summary>

**A = \{letters in “KATHMANDU”\}**

List the distinct letters in "KATHMANDU":  
K, A, T, H, M, N, D, U  
There are 8 distinct letters.

**Cardinality of A:** $n(A) = 8$

**B = \{multiples of 5 ≤ 50\}**

List the multiples of 5 up to 50: \{5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50\}  
There are 10 such numbers.

**Cardinality of B:** $n(B) = 10$
