# Cardinality of Sets

The **cardinality** of a set is the number of elements in it. It tells us how many distinct items are in the set.

If a set $𝐴 =\{2,4,6,8\}$, then the cardinality of $𝐴$ is 4.

It is denoted by $𝑛(𝐴)$, meaning “number of elements in set A.”

Example: Let $𝑉=\{𝑎,𝑒,𝑖,𝑜,𝑢\}$
Then, $𝑛(𝑉) = 5$

<div className="question">
  <b>Q1.</b> What is the cardinality of the set of letters in ‘Mississippi’?
  <details>
  <summary>Show solution</summary>

The distinct letters in 'Mississippi' are: M, I, S, P.
So, the cardinality is $n = 4$.

</div>

:::tip Explanation

<b>Distinct Elements</b> - A set always has distinct elements. Meaning, no repetitions
allowed!

## Key Terms

| Term          | Meaning                                                |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Cardinality   | The number of elements in a set                        |
| n(A)          | Number of elements in set A                            |
| n(A ∩ B)      | Number of elements common to both A and B              |
| n(A ∪ B)      | Number of elements in either A or B or both            |
| $n_o(A)$      | Number of elements only in A (i.e., in A but not in B) |
| Disjoint Sets | Sets with no common elements; $A \cap B = \emptyset$   |

## Important Formulas

:::info Disjoint Sets
**No common elements:**

$$
n(A \cup B) = n(A) + n(B)
$$

:::

:::info Intersecting Sets
**Some elements are common:**

$$
n(A \cup B) = n(A) + n(B) - n(A \cap B)
$$

:::

:::info Only in A or B
**Elements only in A:**

$$
n_o(A) = n(A) - n(A \cap B)
$$

**Elements only in B:**

$$
n_o(B) = n(B) - n(A \cap B)
$$

:::

:::info Universal Set Relationships
**If all elements are in A and B only:**

$$
n(U) = n(A \cup B)
$$

**If U has other elements too:**

$$
n(U) = n(A \cup B) + n(\text{outside } A \cup B)
$$

## Method: How to Find Cardinality

- List all elements in each set.

- Identify common elements (intersection).

- Apply formulas based on whether sets are disjoint or intersecting.

- Use Venn diagrams to visualize and verify.
