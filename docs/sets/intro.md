# Introduction to Sets

A **set** is a **well-defined** collection of **distinct** objects.
**Well-defined** means we can clearly decide whether an object belongs to the set or not.

Examples include:

- Set of prime numbers less than 10: `{2, 3, 5, 7}`
- Set of letters in the word "NEPAL": `{N, E, P, A, L}`
- Natural numbers: `N = {1,2,3,...}`

We will study operations on sets, cardinality, exercises, and quizzes in this unit.

Examples from Daily Life

| Days of the week | `D = {Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, ..., Saturday}` |
| Vowels in English | `V = {a, e, i, o, u}` |
