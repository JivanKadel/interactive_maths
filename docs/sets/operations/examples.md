# Operations Examples

**Example 1:**  
`A = {x | x is an even number ≤ 10}`  
`B = {x | x is a multiple of 3 ≤ 10}`

- `A ∪ B = {2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10}`
- `A ∩ B = {6}`
- `A − B = {2, 4, 8, 10}`
- `B − A = {3, 9}`

**Example 2:**  
`A = {a, b, c}`, `B = {b, c, d}`

- `A ∪ B = {a, b, c, d}`
- `A ∩ B = {b, c}`
