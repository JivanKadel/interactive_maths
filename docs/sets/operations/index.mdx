# Operations on Sets

Set operations help us combine, compare, or separate sets based on their elements. These operations are useful in organizing data, solving problems, and understanding relationships between groups.

## Common Set Operations

- **Union (A ∪ B)**: All elements in A or B or both.
- **Intersection (A ∩ B)**: Elements common to A and B.
- **Difference (A − B)**: Elements in A not in B.
- **Complement (Aᶜ)**: Elements not in A (relative to universal set U).

### 1. Union of Sets (A ∪ B)

  <figcaption>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

The union of two sets A and B includes all elements that are in A, in B, or in both.

  />

  </figcaption>
</figure>

Duplicate elements are written only once.

Example: If `A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}` `B = {4, 5, 6, 7}` Then `A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}`

Set Builder Notation: `A ∪ B = {x : x ∈ A or x ∈ B}`

### 2. Intersection of Sets (A ∩ B)

<figure>
  <img

    alt="Venn diagram showing the intersection of sets A and B"
  />
  <figcaption>
    <b>Figure 3:</b> Intersection of two sets A and B.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

The intersection includes only the elements that are common to both sets A and B.

Example: `A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}` `B = {4, 5, 6, 7}` Then `A ∩ B = {4, 5, 6}`

Set Builder Notation: `A ∩ B = {x : x ∈ A and x ∈ B}`

### 3. Difference of Sets (A − B)

<figure>
  <img
    src={useBaseUrl("/img/sets/sets_difference.png")}
    alt="Venn diagram showing the difference of sets A and B"
  />
  <figcaption>
    <b>Figure 4:</b> Set Difference: <b>(A - B)</b>.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
  <img
    src={useBaseUrl("/img/sets/sets_difference_1.png")}
    alt="Venn diagram showing the difference of sets B and A"
  />
  <figcaption>
    <b>Figure 5:</b> Set Difference: <b>(B - A)</b>.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

The difference `A − B` includes elements that are in A but not in B.

Example: `A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}` `B = {4, 5, 6, 7}` Then `A − B = {1, 2, 3}`

Note: `A − B = A − (A ∩ B)`

:::important
Remember that **A ∩ B = B ∩ A**, but **A − B ≠ B − A**.

### 4. Symmetric Difference (A Δ B)

<figure>

    alt="Venn diagram showing the Symmetric difference of sets B and A"
  />
  <figcaption>
    <b>Figure 6:</b> Symmetric Difference: <b>(A Δ B)</b>.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

The symmetric difference includes elements that are in A or B but not in both.

Formula: `A Δ B = (A − B) ∪ (B − A)`

Example: `A − B = {1, 2, 3}` `B − A = {7}` So, `A Δ B = {1, 2, 3, 7}`

### 5. Complement of a Set [A̅ or (A∪B)<sup>c</sup>]

<figure>

    src={useBaseUrl("/img/sets/sets_complement.png")}
    alt="Venn diagram showing the Complement of A union B"

    <b>Figure 7:</b> Complement of A union B:{" "}
    <b> (A ∪ B)<sup>c</sup></b>.

  <img

    alt="Venn diagram showing the Complement of A"
  />
  <figcaption>
    <b>Figure 8: </b> Complement of A: {" "}
    <b> (A̅) or A <sup> c </sup></b>
    .

  </figcaption>
</figure>

The complement of set A includes all elements in the universal set U that are not in A.

Example: `U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}` `A = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}` Then `A̅ = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}`

Set Builder Notation: `A̅ = {x : x ∈ U and x ∉ A}`
